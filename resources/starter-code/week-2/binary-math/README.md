# Messages with JS

Each group member will create a page and a js file. Name the page and js file after your one name, e.g. `john.html` and `john.js`.

Use the starter code in index.html and script.js as an example. (You may copy them to your own files using the cp command in the terminal.)

Update them to include a message. The message should be at least 3 characters long and should be displayed in the browser when the page is loaded.

You may copy and paste code to make more characters appear. (You may also think of another way to do so without copying and pasting so much.)

We will discuss your ideas at the end of class.

When you are done, commit your changes, pull and push to the repository.
