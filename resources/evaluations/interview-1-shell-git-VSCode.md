### üéØ Interview Purpose & Expectations

This graded interview is designed to assess your ability to work confidently with the basic tools used in our web development workflow: Git Bash (or another shell), Git, VSCode, and GitHub. You will complete a sequence of hands-on tasks that reflect real coding practices‚Äîcreating files, using Emmet, committing changes, pushing to GitHub, resolving conflicts, and deploying to GitHub Pages.

You will have **15 minutes** to complete the interview. Be prepared to think and move efficiently. Your goal is to demonstrate fluency and independence in each step. You may use notes, so have your notes ready, if you think you will need them.

‚úÖ **Before starting**, make sure you have:

* **VSCode installed**
* **Git installed and configured**
* **A working shell (Git Bash, Terminal, or similar)**
* **An active GitHub account and access to your browser**

You may use the tools you‚Äôve learned in class but should not receive help during the interview unless prompted by the TA. Each task will be scored on your level of independence and confidence. Good luck‚Äîyou‚Äôve got this! üí™
