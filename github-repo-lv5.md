### Lesson: Publishing with GitHub Pages (Classic)

#### Objective:

Learn how to publish your `index.html` file as a live website using GitHub Pages (Classic).

#### Prerequisite:

You should have a repository with an `index.html` file committed to the `main` branch.

#### Steps:

1. **Go to Your Repository Settings**

   * Navigate to your repository.
   * Click the **"Settings"** tab near the top right of the page.

2. **Scroll to the GitHub Pages Section**

   * Scroll down until you see the **"Pages"** section under "Code and automation".

3. **Configure GitHub Pages (Classic)**

   * Under **Source**, choose `Deploy from a branch`.
   * In the dropdown menu, select:

     * **Branch:** `main`
     * **Folder:** `/ (root)`
   * Click **Save**.

4. **Wait for Deployment**

   * After saving, GitHub will display a link to your live website.
   * It can take up to 5 minutes for the link to appear. If it takes too long, feel free to come back to this later.
   * The link will look something like:

     `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`

5. **Test Your Website**

   * Click the link to view your `index.html` live online.

#### Practice Activity:

* Open your live GitHub Page.
* Check that your `index.html` content appears correctly.
* Share the link with a partner and view each other's pages.
