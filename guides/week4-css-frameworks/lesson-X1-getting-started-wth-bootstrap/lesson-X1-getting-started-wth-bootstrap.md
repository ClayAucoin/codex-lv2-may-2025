Paragraph 2: Aliens have landed in the southeastern corner of Hammond Community Park last night at approximately 11:37 PM. Witnesses describe a silent, disc-shaped craft emitting a soft blue glow. Local resident Martha Jenkins captured footage on her phone before authorities established a two-mile exclusion zone around the site.
