## Step 3: Learn Bootstrap Basics

Visit these links on W3 Schools. Read or skim the lessons. Click on the TRY IT YOURSELF button to see an example of the code.

After you finish, answer the questions in your group.

For this section, you will not use VSCode. Just use the TRY IT YOURSELF button. Be sure to make some changes to the code if you are curious as to what things do. Don't be afraid to break the code, it will revert back if you refresh!

## Day 1 Bootstrap Setup and Basic HTML Elements

Visit these sites links. Click on TRY IT YOURSELF. Get a general understanding of how it works. Then answer the questions at the end with your group.

Questions for Day 1

For #2 Getting Started

1. How do you use Bootstrap in your project? (What line(s) of code is needed?)

For #3 Bootstrap Containers

1. There are two container types in Bootstrap. class=‚Äùcontainer‚Äù is often used for desktop focused website. class=‚Äùcontainer‚Äù is often used for mobile focused web-apps. Try them both out in the W3 Schools Playground. What is the difference?

For #4 Bootstrap Typography

1. Bootstrap allows you to style any HTML Element as an h1 or h2. How is this done and why might it be useful?
2. Bootstrap has many classes to change the style of text. Which Bootstrap Typography class would you find most useful? Why?

For #5 Colors

1. Bootstrap has many, many classes. How might your remember them them? Are there any patterns to the way they are named?

For #6 Buttons

1. Buttons classes can be applied to any html element. Why might you want to apply a button class to an a tag. For example:  <a class=‚Äùbtn btn-primary‚Äù href=‚Äù#‚Äù> tag?

For #7 Images

1. Which of these images classes would you like to use later? Write one or two into your notebook so you remember.


## Step 4

### Try it! (Mini-Project)

Now you have all the tools you need to re-create the first screen of the Water Conservation App in code.org Lesson 1. Have a look at it, and try to build it with HTML and the Bootstrap CSS Framework. Refer to the lesson on code.org and to the docs on W3 to help you. 

To get started with a project, you may refer to the [start a project skill guide](../../../resources/skill-guides/start-project.md).

Remember to add and commit after each successful milestone. See the [git snippets](../../../resources/git-snippets.md) for useful command.

You may work on this together, but it is not a group project. Each individual should have their own git repository and code. If you finish early, as a challenge, you may create your own app idea using HTML and Bootstrap. (For example, a HOW TO Guide, or a HEALTH TIPS Guide.)
