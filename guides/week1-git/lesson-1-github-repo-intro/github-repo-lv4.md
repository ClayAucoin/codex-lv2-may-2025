### Lesson: Creating an `index.html` File on GitHub

#### Objective:

Learn how to create and edit an `index.html` file directly on GitHub's web interface. This will be your website's homepage.

#### Prerequisite:

You should have already created a repository with a README file, as covered in the previous lesson.

#### Steps:

1. **Navigate to Your Repository**

   * Go to your repository on GitHub.

2. **Add a New File**

   * Click the **"Add file"** button, then select **"Create new file"**.
   * In the file name field, type `index.html`.

3. **Write HTML Content**

   * In the editor box, write a simple HTML structure like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is my first HTML file on GitHub.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

4. **Commit the New File**

   * Below the editor, write a short commit message such as "Add index.html with basic structure."
   * Select **"Commit directly to the main branch"**.
   * Click **"Commit new file"**.

#### Practice Activity:

* Create your own `index.html` file with personalized content.
* Try adding elements like a second heading (`<h2>`), a list, or a link.

#### Tip:

Once youâ€™ve added your `index.html`, you can enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings to view your site live!
