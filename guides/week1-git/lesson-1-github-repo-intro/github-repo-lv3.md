### Lesson: Editing a README on GitHub Web Interface

#### Objective:

Learn how to edit your project's README file directly on GitHub's website. A README file serves as an introduction and documentation for your project, providing essential details such as project purpose, setup instructions, usage guidelines, and contributors.

#### Creating a Repository:

1. **Create a New Repository**

   * Log in to GitHub and click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner, then select **"New repository"**.
   * Give your repository a meaningful name (e.g., `my-first-repo`).
   * Optionally, add a description and choose to make the repo public or private.
   * Check the box to **"Add a README file"** and click **"Create repository"**.

#### Steps:

1. **Navigate to Repository**

   * Go to GitHub and select the repository containing the README you want to edit.

2. **Open the README file**

   * Click on `README.md` from the repository file list.

3. **Edit README**

   * Click the pencil icon labeled **"Edit this file"** located near the top right corner.
   * Use the web editor to make your changes directly.

4. **Commit Changes**

   * Write a clear, descriptive commit message summarizing your changes.
   * Commit directly to the main branch.
   * Click **"Commit changes"**.

#### Example Content:

To get started, you can write something simple in your README like:

```
# My First Project
A simple website created to practice GitHub collaboration.
```
