### 🧠 Why Use GitHub Issues?

* **Report bugs**: Let the team know something isn't working as expected.
* **Request features**: Share ideas for new content or functionality.
* **Ask questions**: Clarify parts of the code or documentation.
* **Track progress**: Assign tasks and mark them complete.

### 📝 Steps to Create an Issue

1. **Go to the Repository**
   Navigate to your project repository or any public repository where you'd like to submit an issue.

2. **Click on the Issues Tab**
   At the top of the repo, click **"Issues"**, then click the green **"New issue"** button.

3. **Fill in the Issue Details**

   * **Title**: Write a short, clear title (e.g., "Image does not load on contact page").
   * **Description**: Include as much detail as needed:

     * What page/file the problem occurs on
     * Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable)
     * Screenshots (if helpful)

4. **Submit the Issue**
   Click **"Submit new issue"**. The issue will now appear in the list.

5. *(Optional)* Assign labels or assignees if you're working in a group.

**Issue #1097: Course not available**
Notice how the user clearly described a broken link and explained what was wrong.
