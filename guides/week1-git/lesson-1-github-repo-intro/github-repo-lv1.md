## Lesson: Explore Example Open‑Source Repos 🧐

### 🎯 Objective

Investigate existing open-source projects to understand real-world file organization, documentation, and collaboration practices.

### 🔍 Step 1: Explore the Code.org Website Repository

* Visit the **[Code.org/code-dot-org repository](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org)**.
* Focus on:

  * The **README.md**: How it explains the project and its goals
  * The **About section**: How they describe the repository and include a website link
  * The **file structure**: What folders and files are used to organize the project

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Inspect a Beginner-Friendly Open Source List

* Check out **[MunGell/awesome-for-beginners](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners)** — a curated list of repos labeled “good first issue.”
* Focus on:

  * The **README.md**: How the list is explained and structured
  * The **About section**: Project purpose and external links
  * The **file structure**: How categories are organized into folders and files

---

### 🔍 Step 3: Examine an Education‑Focused Curriculum Project

* Explore **[ossu/computer-science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)** (Open Source Society University).
* Focus on:

  * The **README.md**: How it communicates the structure and content of the curriculum
  * The **About section**: What info is shared and how it links to the learning platform
  * The **file structure**: How curriculum and resources are organized in the repository

### ✅ Practice Activity

1. Visit each repo listed above.
2. Look for:

   * Purpose or description (README + About section)
   * How the files are organized (folders, structure)
   * Signs of collaboration (issues, pull requests, contributing guidelines)
3. Write down **two things** you like or would adapt in your own project.

---

### 📝 Reflection Questions

* How do these repos help new contributors understand the project?
* What strategies could you borrow to improve your own project’s README or structure?
