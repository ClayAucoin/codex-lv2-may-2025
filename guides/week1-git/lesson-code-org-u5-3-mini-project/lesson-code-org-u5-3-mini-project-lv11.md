## Step 11: Link Individual Pages 🔗

### 🎯 Objective

Add links to all individual team member pages from the main landing page to create a complete navigation system.

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open the Main Page**
   - Open `index.html` in your code editor
   - Find a good location to add the individual page links

2. **Create a Team Members Section**
   - Add a new section titled "Team Member Pages" or similar
   - This will be where you list all the individual pages

3. **Add Links to Individual Pages**
   - Create links to each team member's page:
     ```html
     <a href="[name]-message.html">[Name]'s Message</a>
     ```
   - Replace `[name]` with each team member's actual name
   - Make sure the filenames match exactly

4. **Organize the Links**
   - List the links in a logical order (alphabetical, by role, etc.)
   - Add brief descriptions if desired
   - Make sure the formatting is consistent

5. **Test All Links**
   - Click on each link to make sure it works
   - Verify that all individual pages are accessible
   - Check that navigation back to the main page works
