## Step 6: Update ASCII Binary Page 🔤

### 🎯 Objective

Customize the ASCII binary encoding page with your group's chosen emojis and create encoded messages.

---

### 📋 Task Requirements

**Who:** ALL team members (ONE person drives, others navigate)

---

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Choose Your Emojis**
   - As a group, decide on two emojis to replace 🍎 and 🍌
   - Make sure the emojis are distinct and easy to distinguish
   - Write down your emoji choices

2. **Open the File**
   - Open `encoding-ascii.html` in your code editor
   - Look for the sections that use 🍎 and 🍌

3. **Replace the Emojis**
   - Find all instances of 🍎 and replace with your first chosen emoji
   - Find all instances of 🍌 and replace with your second chosen emoji
   - Update both the visual examples and the ASCII table

4. **Create Your Group's Messages**
   - Replace the example messages with your own encoded messages
   - Create at least 3 different messages using your emoji system
   - Make sure the messages are appropriate and fun

5. **Update the ASCII Table**
   - Ensure the binary values are correct (🍎 = 01000001, 🍌 = 01000010)
   - Update the table to show your new emojis with their binary values
   - Make sure the table is complete and accurate

---

### ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Emojis replaced with group's chosen symbols
- [ ] At least 3 encoded messages created
- [ ] ASCII table updated with correct binary values
- [ ] All examples use the new emoji system consistently

---

### 💡 Tips

- Choose emojis that are clearly different from each other
- Test your encoding by decoding the messages to make sure they work
- Keep messages short and simple for easier testing
- Make sure everyone in the group understands the encoding system
