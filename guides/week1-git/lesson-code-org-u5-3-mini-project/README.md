## üìÅ **Project Structure**

Your final repository should contain:
```
your-project-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              # Main landing page

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ encoding-emojis.html    # Custom emoji alphabet page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Project documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [group-member-files]/  # Individual student pages
```

## ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Phase 1: Setup and Planning **

1. **Form Your Group**
   - Work with 3-4 classmates
   - Assign roles: Repository Owner, HTML Specialist, Content Creator, Quality Assurance

2. **Create the Repository**
   - One group member creates a new GitHub repository
   - Name it something like: `emoji-encoding-project-[group-name]`
   - Make it public so others can view your work

3. **Add Collaborators**
   - Repository owner adds all group members as collaborators [show me how](https://youtu.be/oqLFn8L7x9w?feature=shared)
   - Each member should accept the invitation

### **Phase 2: Initial Setup **

4. **Get the Starter Code**
   - Navigate to `starter-code/week-1/binary-encoding/` in this course [ link ](../../../resources/starter-code/week-1/binary-encoding/)
   - Copy the following files to your repository:
     - `index.html`
     - `encoding-ascii.html`
     - `encoding-emojis.html`

5. **Clone and Setup**
   - Each group member clones the repository to their local machine

### **Phase 3: Customize Encoding Systems **

6. **Update ASCII Binary Page**
   - Work as a group. Choose ONE person to DRIVE. The others will NAVIGATE.
   - Modify `encoding-ascii.html` to use your group's chosen emojis
   - Replace üçé and üçå with your own emoji choices
   - Update the example messages with your group's encoded messages
   - Ensure the ASCII table is complete and accurate

7. **Update Custom Emoji Alphabet Page**
   - Work as a group. Choose ONE person to DRIVE. The others will NAVIGATE.
   - Modify `encoding-emojis.html` to use your group's emoji alphabet
   - Replace the emoji system with your own encoding rules
   - Update the decoder key table with your complete A-Z mapping
   - Add your group's encoded messages

8. **Update Main Landing Page**
   - Work as a group. Choose ONE person to DRIVE. The others will NAVIGATE.
   - Modify `index.html` to reflect your group's project
   - Add proper navigation between pages
   - Include group member information and project description

9. **IMPORTANT: Git Collaboration Workflow**
    - **Before making changes:** Always `git pull` to get the latest version
    - **After making changes:** 
      - `git add .` to stage your changes
      - `git commit -m "descriptive message"` to commit
      - `git push` to upload to GitHub
    - **Communication:** Let your team know when you're pushing changes
    - **Conflict Prevention:** Work on different files when possible
    - **If conflicts occur:** Communicate with your team to resolve them

### **Phase 4: Individual Contributions **

10. **Create Individual Pages**
   - Each group member creates their own HTML file
   - File naming: `[student-name]-message.html`
   - Include your personal encoded message using your choice of emojis
   - Add a hint for others to decode your message

11. **Link Individual Pages**
    - Add links to individual pages from the main `index.html`
    - Ensure all pages are properly connected

12. **IMPORTANT: Git Collaboration Workflow**
    - **Before making changes:** Always `git pull` to get the latest version
    - **After making changes:** 
      - `git add .` to stage your changes
      - `git commit -m "descriptive message"` to commit
      - `git push` to upload to GitHub
    - **Communication:** Let your team know when you're pushing changes
    - **Conflict Prevention:** Work on different files when possible
    - **If conflicts occur:** Communicate with your team to resolve them 
    - **See this [tutorial](./conflicts.md) on conflicts**

### **Phase 5: Testing and Refinement (30 minutes)**

13. **Test Your Website**
    - Verify all links work correctly
    - Test the encoding/decoding systems
    - Check that all group members' pages are accessible
    - Ensure the website looks good on different screen sizes

14. **Final Documentation**
    - Update the README.md with:
      - Project description
      - Group member names and roles
      - Instructions for using the encoding systems
      - How to decode the messages
      - Links to all pages
