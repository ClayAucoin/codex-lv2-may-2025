## Unit Overview: Collaborative Emoji Encoding Website Project

### üß≠ Objective

In this unit, groups of 3-4 students will collaboratively create a website that demonstrates different encoding systems using emojis. This project combines concepts from Code.org Unit 5 lessons 2 and 3, along with Git collaboration skills.

### üë• Group Collaboration Goals

* Practice GitHub workflows in a team setting
* Apply encoding concepts from Code.org Unit 5
* Create and modify HTML files with proper structure
* Implement different encoding systems (custom emoji alphabet and ASCII binary)
* Work as a team to build a cohesive website
