## Step 9: Git Collaboration Workflow üîÑ

### üéØ Objective

Learn and practice the proper Git workflow for collaborative development to avoid conflicts and maintain project integrity.

---

### üìã Task Requirements

**Who:** ALL team members

---

### üîç Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Before Making Changes**
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```
   - Always pull the latest changes before starting work
   - This ensures you have the most recent version

2. **After Making Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "descriptive message"
   git push
   ```
   - Stage all your changes with `git add .`
   - Commit with a clear, descriptive message
   - Push your changes to GitHub

3. **Communication Protocol**
   - Let your team know when you're about to push changes
   - Coordinate who works on which files to avoid conflicts
   - Use clear commit messages that explain what you changed

4. **Conflict Prevention**
   - Work on different files when possible
   - Communicate with your team about what you're working on
   - Pull changes frequently to stay in sync

5. **If Conflicts Occur**
   - Don't panic! Conflicts are normal in collaboration
   - Communicate with your team to resolve them
   - See the [conflicts tutorial](./conflicts.md) for detailed help
