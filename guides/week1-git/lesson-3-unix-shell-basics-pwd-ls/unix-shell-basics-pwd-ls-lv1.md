# Introduction to the Unix Shell

---

The Unix shell is a powerful tool that lets you control your computer using text commands. It's been around for decades because it's efficient and great for automating tasks. These lessons will help you get started using the shell to work with files and folders, and prepare you for more advanced computing later.

Follow these steps to get set up:

### Steps

1. **Check that you're ready**
   If you’ve ever saved a file on a computer and know what a “folder” or “directory” is, you’re ready for this lesson.

2. **Download the lesson files**

   * Download `shell-lesson-data.zip` from the [week1-git directory](../shell-lesson-data.zip).
   * Move the `.zip` file to your Desktop.
   * Unzip (extract) the file. You should now see a folder named `shell-lesson-data` on your Desktop.
   * Ask your instructor if you need help with this step.

3. **Install shell software (if needed)**
   If you don’t already have a terminal or shell installed, install one now:

   * [Installation Information](./unix-shell-install.md)

4. **Open the terminal**

   * Open your shell program.
   * In the terminal window, type:

     ```
     cd
     ```

     and press **Return**. This puts you in your home directory, which is a safe place to start.

### Notes

* The shell (also called the **terminal** or **command line**) is a place where you type commands instead of clicking with your mouse.
* During the lesson, you will use the terminal to navigate into the `shell-lesson-data` folder and work with its files.
