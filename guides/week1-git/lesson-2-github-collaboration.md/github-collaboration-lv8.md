## Lesson: Assign Pages and Begin Development

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

ðŸ‘‰ **Why We Use Personal Branches:** Developing on your own branch keeps the `main` branch clean and stable. It prevents accidental changes or conflicts with teammates' work. Once your updates are ready and reviewed, they can be safely merged into `main`.

Each team member will create their assigned HTML file on their personal branch and begin adding basic content for their individual page.

### ðŸ‘£ Steps

1. **Check That You're on Your Own Branch**

   * At the top left of the repository page, look for the branch dropdown.
   * It should display your personal branch name (e.g., `alex-page`).
   * If it says `main`, click it and switch to your correct branch before proceeding.

2. **Review Your Assigned Page**

   * Confirm the file name assigned to you (e.g., `alex.html`, `jordan.html`).
   * Make sure you are working on your own personal branch.

3. **Create a New HTML File**

   * In your branch, click **"Add file"** > **"Create new file"**.
   * Name the file exactly as assigned (e.g., `alex.html`).

4. **Add Starter HTML Content**
   Use this basic template to start your page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Your Name's Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Your Name</h1>
  <p>This is my personal page for our group project.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

* Replace "Your Name" with your actual name.
* You can add more content later!

5. **Commit the File**

   * Scroll down and add a message like "Add my personal page".
   * Commit the new file **to your branch**.

### ðŸ’¬ Discussion Prompt

Why does each person work on their own branch instead of editing the main branch directly?

ðŸ‘‰ **Explanation:** Developing on your own branch keeps the main branch clean and stable while you work on your part of the project. It prevents accidental changes or conflicts with your teammates' work. Once your work is ready and reviewed, it can be safely merged into the main branch.
