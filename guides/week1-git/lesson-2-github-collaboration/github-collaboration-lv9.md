## Lesson: Create Pull Requests

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Each team member will open a pull request (PR) from their personal branch into `main`, providing a clear description of what their page contributes to the project.

---

### ðŸ‘£ Steps

1. **Go to the Pull Requests Tab**

   * In your repository, click the **Pull requests** tab.
   * Click the green **"New pull request"** button.

2. **Choose the Correct Branches**

   * For the base branch, select `main`.
   * For the compare branch, select your personal branch (e.g., `alex-page`).
   * Confirm the changes listed are correct.

3. **Add a Title and Description**

   * Use a short, clear title like: `Add Alex's personal page`.
   * In the description box, briefly explain what you added (e.g., "Created alex.html with a heading and paragraph about me.")

4. **Submit the Pull Request**

   * Click **"Create pull request"**.
   * Your teammates will now be able to review your code and merge it later.
