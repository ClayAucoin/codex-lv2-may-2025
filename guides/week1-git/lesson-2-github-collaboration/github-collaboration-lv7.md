## Lesson: Create a Personal Branch to Work on Your Page

**[← Previous: Update README](github-collaboration-lv6.md)** | **[Next: Create Personal Page →](github-collaboration-lv8.md)** | **[Back to Overview](README.md)**

### 🎯 Objective

Each team member will create a personal branch in the shared repository to safely develop their individual page without affecting the main branch.

### 👣 Steps

1. **Go to the Shared Repository**

   * Visit your team’s GitHub repository.

2. **Open the Branch Menu**

   * Near the top-left, you’ll see a dropdown labeled `main`.
   * Click it to open the branch menu.

3. **Create a New Branch**

   * Type your branch name in the field (e.g., `alex-page`, `jordan-html`, or `sam-content`).
   * Click **"Create branch: \[your-branch-name] from 'main'"**.

4. **Verify You’re on Your Branch**

   * You should now see your branch name instead of `main` at the top-left.
   * Any changes you make now will only apply to your branch.
   * Wait until the next step to start work on your page.
