## Unit Overview: Collaborative Website Project on GitHub Pages

### ðŸ§­ Objective

In this unit, groups of 2â€“4 students will collaboratively create a multi-page website hosted on GitHub Pages. Each student will be responsible for contributing their own page using branches and pull requests.

---

### ðŸ‘¥ Group Collaboration Goals

* Practice GitHub workflows in a team setting
* Use branches and pull requests for collaborative development
* Assign and manage individual responsibilities within a group project

---

### ðŸ“š Lesson Outline

1. View other Repositories *(Group)*

2. **Create a Shared Repository** *(Group)* &#x20;
   One group member creates a GitHub repo and initializes it with a README.

3. **Add Collaborators and Accept Invitations** *(Group)* &#x20;
   Group members are invited as collaborators and accept their GitHub invitations.

4. **Create an `index.html` Page on `main`** *(Group)* &#x20;
   The homepage introduces the group and links to individual pages. Publish the site using GitHub Pages.

5. **Plan the Site as a Group** *(Group)* &#x20;
   Groups draft a plan showing which member will create which page (e.g., About Me, Resources, Gallery). Include a simple example layout.

6. **Update Readme** *(Group)* &#x20;
   Update your repositoryâ€™s README file as a group using a shared template to describe your project, team members, and site layout.

7. **Create a Branch for Each Collaborator** *(Individual)* &#x20;
   Each member creates a personal branch to work on their page.

8. **Assign Pages and Begin Development** *(Individual)* &#x20;
   Members each create a new HTML file (e.g., `alex.html`, `jordan.html`) on their own branch.

9. **Create Pull Requests** *(Individual)* &#x20;
   Collaborators open pull requests with a description of what their page adds.

10. **Review and Merge Pull Requests** *(Group)* &#x20;
   Team members review PRs and merge them into `main`.

11. **Test Live GitHub Page** *(Group)* &#x20;
    Visit the deployed site and check that all pages are accessible and functioning.

12. **Create and Assign GitHub Issues** *(Individual)* &#x20;
    Each student creates at least one issue in the repository. For example, "add a new paragraph" or "create a list".

13. **Create a Branch to Resolve an Issue** *(Individual)* &#x20;
    After selecting an issue (assigned or created), students create a new branch (e.g., `fix-photo-section`) to resolve it. They make the necessary changes, commit with a message that references the issue (e.g., `Fixes #12`), and open a pull request. Once reviewed, they merge the changes back to `main`.

14. **Add a Shared CSS File via GitHub Issue (Challenge)** *(Group)* &#x20;
    As a group, create a GitHub issue titled something like "Add shared CSS styling." Only one team member will do this task.

15. **Link to CSS from Personal Page (Challange)** *(Individual)* &#x20;
    After the shared `style.css` has been merged into `main`, each student creates a new issue in the repository (e.g., "Link CSS to jordan.html"). Then:

    * Create a new branch to complete the task (e.g., `link-css-jordan`)
    * Edit their personal HTML file to include: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` in the `<head>`
    * **Do not change the CSS file itself**â€”only link to it
    * Commit the changes with a message referencing the issue number
    * Open a pull request and merge once approved
