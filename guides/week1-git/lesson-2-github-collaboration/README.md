## Unit Overview: Collaborative Website Project on GitHub Pages

### ðŸ§­ Objective

In this unit, groups of 2â€“4 students will collaboratively create a multi-page website hosted on GitHub Pages. Each student will be responsible for contributing their own page using branches and pull requests.

---

### ðŸ‘¥ Group Collaboration Goals

* Practice GitHub workflows in a team setting
* Use branches and pull requests for collaborative development
* Assign and manage individual responsibilities within a group project

### ðŸ“š Lesson List

1. **[Create a Shared Repository](./github-collaboration-lv2.md)** *(Group)*  
   One group member creates a GitHub repo and initializes it with a README.

2. **[Add Collaborators and Accept Invitations](./github-collaboration-lv3.md)** *(Group)*  
   Group members are invited as collaborators and accept their GitHub invitations.

3. **[Create an index.html Page on main](./github-collaboration-lv4.md)** *(Group)*  
   The homepage introduces the group and links to individual pages. Publish the site using GitHub Pages.

4. **[Plan the Site as a Group](./github-collaboration-lv5.md)** *(Group)*  
   Groups draft a plan showing which member will create which page (e.g., About Me, Resources, Gallery). Include a simple example layout.

5. **[Update README](./github-collaboration-lv6.md)** *(Group)*  
   Update your repository's README file as a group using a shared template to describe your project, team members, and site layout.

6. **[Create a Branch for Each Collaborator](./github-collaboration-lv7.md)** *(Individual)*  
   Each member creates a personal branch to work on their page.

7. **[Assign Pages and Begin Development](./github-collaboration-lv8.md)** *(Individual)*  
   Members each create a new HTML file (e.g., `alex.html`, `jordan.html`) on their own branch.

8. **[Create Pull Requests](./github-collaboration-lv9.md)** *(Individual)*  
   Collaborators open pull requests with a description of what their page adds.

9. **[Review and Merge Pull Requests](./github-collaboration-lv10.md)** *(Group)*  
   Team members review PRs and merge them into `main`.

10. **[Test Live GitHub Page](./github-collaboration-lv11.md)** *(Group)*  
    Visit the deployed site and check that all pages are accessible and functioning.

11. **[Create and Assign GitHub Issues](./github-collaboration-lv12.md)** *(Individual)*  
    Each student creates at least one issue in the repository. For example, "add a new paragraph" or "create a list".

12. **[Create a Branch to Resolve an Issue](./github-collaboration-lv13.md)** *(Individual)*  
    After selecting an issue (assigned or created), students create a new branch (e.g., `fix-photo-section`) to resolve it. They make the necessary changes, commit with a message that references the issue (e.g., `Fixes #12`), and open a pull request. Once reviewed, they merge the changes back to `main`.

13. **[Add a Shared CSS File via GitHub Issue](./github-collaboration-lv14.md)** *(Group)* *(Challenge)*  
    As a group, create a GitHub issue titled something like "Add shared CSS styling." Only one team member will do this task.

14. **[Link to CSS from Personal Page](./github-collaboration-lv15.md)** *(Individual)* *(Challenge)*  
    After the shared `style.css` has been merged into `main`, each student creates a new issue in the repository (e.g., "Link CSS to jordan.html"). Then:

    * Create a new branch to complete the task (e.g., `link-css-jordan`)
    * Edit their personal HTML file to include: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` in the `<head>`
    * **Do not change the CSS file itself**â€”only link to it
    * Commit the changes with a message referencing the issue number
    * Open a pull request and merge once approved

### âœ… Project Outcome

By the end of this unit, student groups will:

* Launch a collaboratively-built, multi-page website on GitHub Pages
* Practice inviting collaborators, branching, and merging
* Communicate effectively and document contributions using pull requests and issues
