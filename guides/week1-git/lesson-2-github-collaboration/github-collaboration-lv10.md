## Lesson: Review and Merge Pull Requests

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

As a group, review each other's work and safely merge changes into the `main` branch using GitHub pull requests (PRs).

---

### ðŸ‘£ Steps

1. **Go to the Pull Requests Tab**

   * In your repository, click the **Pull requests** tab at the top.
   * Youâ€™ll see a list of open PRs from teammates' branches.

2. **Review the Pull Request**

   * Click on a PR to open it.
   * Read the description left by your teammate.
   * Click the **"Files changed"** tab to preview the edits.
   * Leave comments or feedback if needed.

3. **Approve and Merge the PR**

   * If the work looks good and there are no conflicts, click **"Merge pull request"**.
   * Then click **"Confirm merge"**.
   * After merging, you can delete the branch (optional).

4. **Repeat for All Team Members**

   * Each teammate should have their work reviewed and merged in the same way.
   * Make sure all branches are merged into `main` before moving on.
