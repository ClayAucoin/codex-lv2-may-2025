## Lesson: Update the README File as a Group

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Collaborate with your group to update the `README.md` file in your repository. This file should describe your project, identify contributors, and outline the site layout.

---

### ðŸ‘£ Steps

1. **Open the README File**

   * Go to your repository on GitHub.
   * Click on `README.md`.
   * Click the pencil icon to edit the file.

2. **Use the Template Below**
   Replace the placeholder content in the README with this template:

```md
# Team Website Project

Welcome to our team website! This site was created as a collaborative project to practice working with GitHub, HTML, and CSS.

## Contributors
- Alex
- Jordan
- Sam

## Pages
- `index.html` â€” Home page with group introduction and links to individual pages
- `alex.html` â€” Alex's introduction page
- `jordan.html` â€” Jordan's portfolio page
- `sam.html` â€” Sam's favorite resources

## Purpose
To learn how to build and deploy a multi-page site as a team using GitHub Pages.
```

3. **Edit for Accuracy**

   * Update the contributor names and page descriptions as needed.
   * Add or remove lines based on your team size.

4. **Commit the Changes**
