## Lesson: Plan the Site as a Group

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Work as a group to plan your team website. Decide who will be responsible for each individual page and what content those pages will include. Start with a shared vision and make sure everyone has a clear assignment.

---

### ðŸ‘£ Steps

1. **Discuss Page Assignments**

   * As a group, decide what each team member's page will focus on.
   * Choose clear, descriptive filenames for each member (e.g., `alex.html`, `jordan.html`, `sam.html`).

2. **Decide on Page Content**

   * Each personal page should include at least:

     * One `<h1>` element with the personâ€™s name or page title
     * One `<p>` paragraph with a short message or introduction

3. **Document the Plan**

   * Use a shared document or write it in the projectâ€™s README.md.
   * Example site plan:

```text
Our Team Website Plan:
- index.html â€“ homepage with links to individual pages
- alex.html â€“ Alex's introduction page
- jordan.html â€“ Jordan's portfolio page
- sam.html â€“ Sam's favorite resources
```

4. **Create Placeholder Content** *(Optional)*

   * Each member can start drafting basic content for their page on paper or in a shared planning doc.

5. **Make Sure Navigation is Covered**

   * Confirm that `index.html` will link to each memberâ€™s page.

### âœ… Practice Check

* [ ] Each team member has a page assigned with a filename
* [ ] The content plan includes an `<h1>` and `<p>` for each page
* [ ] The group has a shared record of the full site layout
