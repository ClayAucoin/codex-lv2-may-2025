## Lesson: Link to CSS from Personal Page

### ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

Once your teamâ€™s shared `style.css` file is in `main`, everyone should link to it from their own page to keep the site consistent and clean. This is your chance to practice using issues, branches, and pull requests individually.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Each student will open an issue, create a new branch, and update their own HTML file to include the shared CSS. You should only link to the fileâ€”**do not edit the CSS itself**.

---

### ðŸ‘£ Steps

1. **Open a GitHub Issue**

   * Go to the **Issues** tab and click **"New issue"**.
   * Title it something like: `Link CSS to jordan.html`.
   * Briefly describe what file youâ€™ll edit and what line youâ€™ll add.
   * Assign the issue to yourself.

2. **Create a New Branch**

   * From the main branch, create a new branch named like `link-css-jordan`.

3. **Edit Your HTML File**

   * In your personal file (e.g., `jordan.html`), locate the `<head>` tag.
   * Add this line inside the head:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

4. **Commit with an Issue Reference**

   * Use a commit message like: `Links CSS file to jordan.html - Fixes #18`

5. **Open a Pull Request and Merge**

   * Open a PR from your branch to `main`.
   * Make sure the PR includes the issue number.
   * After review, merge the changes.

### ðŸ’¬ Discussion Prompt

What problems could happen if students edited the CSS file directly without coordination?
