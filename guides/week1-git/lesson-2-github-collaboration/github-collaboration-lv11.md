## Lesson: Test Live GitHub Page

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

As a group, test your live website on GitHub Pages to confirm that all pages load correctly, navigation works, and the latest updates are visible.

---

### ðŸ‘£ Steps

1. **Visit the GitHub Pages Site**

   * Go to your repository's **Settings** > **Pages**.
   * Click the link to your published site at the top of the Pages section.

2. **Click Through Every Page**

   * On the homepage, click each link to individual member pages.
   * Make sure each page loads without errors.

3. **Check Navigation and Content**

   * Confirm that each page displays the correct content.
   * Check that the groupâ€™s navigation (if added) links properly.

4. **Report and Fix Issues**

   * If something is broken, make a new branch and PR to fix it as a group.
   * Re-test the site after updates are merged.
