### üîß What to Update

Each student should create an issue related to their **own HTML page**. Choose a small but meaningful update.

Example text you can write in your issue:

* **Title:** Add hobbies list to my page
  **Description:** Use a `<ul>` and `<li>` to create a list of my hobbies inside `alex.html`.
* **Title:** Fix missing paragraph closing tag
  **Description:** I noticed one of my `<p>` tags doesn‚Äôt have a closing tag. I‚Äôll fix it in `jordan.html`.
* **Title:** Add a link to index page
  **Description:** I want to add a navigation link at the bottom of `sam.html` to return to the homepage.

Examples of updates:

* Add a new paragraph describing your interests
* Fix any HTML structure issues (e.g., missing `</p>`)
* Add a link to another page in your group
* Use `<ul>` and `<li>` to list your hobbies, skills, or goals
* Create a heading for a new section on your page

Then, assign the issue to yourself and complete the work in a new branch.

* Add a new paragraph to your HTML page
* Fix a missing closing tag in your page
* Create a list using the `<ul>` and `<li>` tags
* Add a link back to the homepage from your page
