# Week 1 Plan

## Day 1

**Introduction to GitHub and Unix Shell Basics**

Start your coding journey by learning the essential tools every developer needs. Today you'll create your first GitHub repository, understand version control concepts, and begin working with the Unix command line interface. You'll learn how to navigate directories, list files, and understand the fundamental structure of your computer's file system.

* [Lesson 2 - GitHub Collaboration](./lesson-2-github-collaboration/)
* [Lesson 3 - Unix Shell Basics](./lesson-3-unix-shell-basics-pwd-ls/)
* [Lesson 4 - Unix Shell Basics - Navigation](./lesson-4-unix-shell-basics-navigation/)

## Day 2

**File Management and Git Integration**

Build on your shell skills by learning how to create, edit, and manage files directly from the command line. You'll discover powerful text editors and file manipulation commands. Then, you'll connect your local development environment with GitHub, learning how to use Git commands to track changes and prepare your work for sharing with others.

* [Lesson 6 - Git Shell](./lesson-6-github-shell/)

## Day 3

**Advanced Git Workflow and Collaboration**

Master the collaborative aspects of software development. You'll learn advanced Git concepts including branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. Discover how to use `.gitignore` files to keep your repositories clean, explore Git history to understand project evolution, and practice the essential push/pull workflow that enables teams to work together effectively on shared codebases.

* [Lesson 7 - History, Gitignore, and Remote Repos](./lesson-7-github-advanced/)
* [Lesson 8 - GitHub Collaboration](./lesson-8-github-collaboration/)

## Day 4

**Data Representation and Encoding Systems**

Dive into the fundamental concepts of how computers store and process information. You'll explore binary number systems, understand how text is encoded using ASCII standards, and discover how emojis and other symbols are represented digitally. These concepts form the foundation of all digital communication and data storage, helping you understand what's happening "under the hood" when you work with computers.

* [code.org Unit 5 Lesson 3 - ASCII Encoding](./lesson-code-org-u5-3-ascii/)

## Day 5

**Mini Group Project: ASCII Encoding Website**

Put all your new skills to work in a collaborative project! Working with your team, you'll design and build a website that demonstrates different encoding systems. This project combines your Git collaboration skills, web development knowledge, and understanding of data representation. You'll practice real-world development workflows while creating something educational and visually appealing that showcases your learning.
