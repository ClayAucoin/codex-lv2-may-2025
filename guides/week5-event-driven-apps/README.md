# Week 5: Event-Driven Apps

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**

Welcome to Week 5! This week focuses on **event-driven programming** using Code.org's self-paced course. You'll learn how to build interactive applications that respond to user input, handle events, and create engaging user experiences.

**Note**: We'll be using Lessons from Code.org's self-paced course on event-driven programming. You may also wish to review additional lessons and videos from the [CS Discoveries 2025 curriculum](https://studio.code.org/courses/csd-2025/units/5) as supplementary resources.
