## ðŸš€ **Step 1: Understanding Buttons and Events**

Buttons are the foundation of interactive apps. They allow users to trigger actions and make your app respond to input.

### **Event Flow:**
1. User clicks a button
2. App detects the click event
3. Event handler function executes
4. App responds with the desired action
