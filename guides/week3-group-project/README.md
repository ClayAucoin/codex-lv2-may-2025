## üìã Project Checklist

### 1. **[Sign Your Group Agreement](./TEAM_AGREEMENT.md)**
Make sure all members read and sign before starting any work.

### 2. **[Complete the Side Scroller Explorer Project](https://github.com/rmccrear/side-scroller-explorer)**
Explore and learn about the differences in workflow between using Game Lab and VSCode + git while making changes to a side-scrolling game. (Work as a team. You may wish to all work together in a pair programming setup, or try and implement a git workflow were all the team members clone the repo and push their changes.)

### 3. **[Review Lesson 27 Plan and Choose Roles](./lesson-27/TEAM-ROLES.md)**
Go over the lesson goals and assign responsibilities within your group.

### 4. **[Complete Lesson 27](./lesson-27/lesson-27.md)**
Work together to build and test the game features for this lesson.

### 5. **[Plan for Lesson 28 and Choose Roles](./lesson-28/TEAM-ROLES.md)** *(Optional)*
If time allows, prepare for the next lesson and assign roles early.

### 6. **[Complete Lesson 28](./lesson-28/lesson-28.md)** *(Optional)*
Finish your full group game project with any additional features.

### 7. **Complete Help Seeker Assignment on Moodle**
Post a clear, concise question on our Slack Cohort Channel about our content so far or an error you've faced. Include relevant code or error details. Follow the [How to Ask Good Questions Guide](../../resources/skill-guides/how-to-ask-good-questions.md) and upload a screenshot of your question and the answer received.

### 8. **Sign up for the Week 3 Interview / Code Review on Moodle**
Each group member should be ready to explain their contributions and code.
