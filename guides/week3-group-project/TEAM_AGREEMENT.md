# Team agreement

Working on a team project—even for just one week—requires clear communication, respect, and shared responsibility. This agreement helps your group set expectations early so that everyone knows their role, when to meet, and how to solve problems together. By signing it, you’re committing to a positive, focused environment where every team member can contribute their best work. It’s not just about building a game—it’s about learning how to collaborate like real developers.


Copy the [Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qQZOxvmZFmijzODqcLFWdm4PATdNMAVbJnSay1A1mwc/edit?usp=sharing), fill it out, and sign it together.
