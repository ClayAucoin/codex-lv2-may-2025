## Lesson: Set Up Your Project Folder

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Create a new project folder structure and initialize a Git repository from the command line.

## âœ… Step 1: Set Up Your Project Folder

### A. Open your Terminal or Git Bash

On your computer, open your command-line tool:

* Windows: Git Bash
* Mac: Terminal or zsh

### B. Move to your home directory and make your folders

In the terminal, run:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p projects/lv2
cd projects/lv2
mkdir vscode-lesson1
cd vscode-lesson1
```

âœ… *This creates a folder for your lesson inside `projects/lv2`, starting from your home directory.*

### C. Create your files

Run these three commands:

```bash
touch index.html
touch README.md
touch style.css
```

âœ… *You now have an empty HTML file, a README, and a CSS file.*

### D. Initialize a Git repository

Run:

```bash
git init
```

âœ… *Now your folder is a Git repo.*

### E. Open your files in your computer's GUI

* Open File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac).
* Navigate to your `projects/lv2/vscode-lesson1` folder.
* You should see the three files you created.
