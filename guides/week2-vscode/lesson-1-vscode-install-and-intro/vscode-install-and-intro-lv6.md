## Lesson: Explore the Editor

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Practice editing files in the VSCode Editor with syntax highlighting and tab management.

---

## âœ… Step 6: Explore the Editor

* The **middle area** of VSCode is the **Editor**.
* When you click a file in the Explorer, it opens in the Editor.
* The editor provides **syntax highlighting** for easier reading of code.

**Activities:**

1. **Write Some HTML:** In `index.html`, type:

```html
<h1>Hello, VSCode!</h1>
<p>This is my first file in VSCode.</p>
```

2. **Create and Edit CSS:** In `style.css`, add:

```css
h1 {
    color: blue;
}
```

3. **Practice Tab Switching:** Click to open multiple files and switch between them using the tabs.

4. **Open the HTML File in a Browser:**

   * In the file browser window you opened earlier, **double-click `index.html`**.
   * It will open in your default web browser so you can see your webpage.

âœ… **Commit Reminder:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Practiced editing files in VSCode and viewed in browser"
git push
```
