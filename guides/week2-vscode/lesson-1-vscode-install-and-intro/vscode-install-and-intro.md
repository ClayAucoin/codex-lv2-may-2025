# üß™ Lesson: Getting Started with VSCode and Git

**Level:** Beginner
**Tools:** Terminal (Git Bash / zsh / Terminal), VSCode
**Goal:** Create a new project folder, set it up in VSCode, and make your first Git commit.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Set Up Your Project Folder

### A. Open your Terminal or Git Bash

On your computer, open your command-line tool:

* Windows: Git Bash
* Mac: Terminal or zsh

### B. Move to your home directory and make your folders

In the terminal, run:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p projects/lv2
cd projects/lv2
mkdir vscode-lesson1
cd vscode-lesson1
```

‚úÖ *This creates a folder for your lesson inside `projects/lv2`, starting from your home directory.*

### C. Create your files

Run these three commands:

```bash
touch index.html
touch README.md
touch style.css
```

‚úÖ *You now have an empty HTML file, a README, and a CSS file.*

### D. Initialize a Git repository

Run:

```bash
git init
```

‚úÖ *Now your folder is a Git repo.*

### E. Open your files in your computer‚Äôs GUI

* Open File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac).
* Navigate to your `projects/lv2/vscode-lesson1` folder.
* You should see the three files you created.

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Open in VSCode

### 1. Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

(Skip this if it's already installed.)

### 2. Open VSCode

Launch the VSCode application.

### 3. Open your project folder

* In VSCode, go to **File ‚Üí Open Folder** (or **File ‚Üí Open** on Mac).
* Navigate to the `vscode-lesson1` folder.
* Open it.

‚úÖ *Now you can see your files in the VSCode file tree.*

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Make a Change and Commit It

### 1. Edit your README

Click on `README.md` in VSCode and type:

```md
# vscode-lesson1

a project to learn vscode with

‚úÖ *You‚Äôve now documented your project.*

### 2. Save and commit your change

In the terminal **inside VSCode**, type:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "updated readme"
```

‚úÖ *You‚Äôve made your first Git commit! üéâ*

‚úÖ Step 4: Open VSCode and Open a Folder

1. After installation, open **VSCode**.
2. The **Welcome screen** will appear.
3. Click **"Open Folder"** (or **File > Open Folder**) to open your project directory.
4. Choose the folder where your files are stored or create a new one.

‚úÖ Step 5: Explore the File Explorer

* Located on the **left side**, click the **Explorer icon** (üìÅ).
* This shows your project‚Äôs files and folders.
* You can right-click to **add, delete, rename, or move files**.

**Activities:**

1. **Create a New File:** Right-click the folder and choose **New File**. Name it `index.html`.
2. **Create a New Folder:** Right-click and select **New Folder**. Name it `assets`.
3. **Rename a File:** Rename `index.html` to `home.html`, then rename it back.
4. **Delete a File:** Create a test file named `delete-me.txt`, then delete it.
5. **Move a File:** Create `move-me.txt` and drag it into the `assets` folder.
6. **Open the Project Folder in Explorer/Finder:**

   * Right-click the project folder in the VSCode **Explorer** panel.
   * Choose **Reveal in File Explorer** (Windows) or **Reveal in Finder** (Mac).
   * This opens the folder in your computer‚Äôs file browser.

‚úÖ Step 6: Explore the Editor

* The **middle area** of VSCode is the **Editor**.
* When you click a file in the Explorer, it opens in the Editor.
* The editor provides **syntax highlighting** for easier reading of code.

**Activities:**

1. **Write Some HTML:** In `index.html`, type:

```html
<h1>Hello, VSCode!</h1>
<p>This is my first file in VSCode.</p>
```

2. **Create and Edit CSS:** In `style.css`, add:

```css
h1 {
    color: blue;
}
```

   * In the file browser window you opened earlier, **double-click `index.html`**.
   * It will open in your default web browser so you can see your webpage.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Practiced editing files in VSCode and viewed in browser"
git push
```
