## Lesson: Getting Started with VSCode Settings

### 🎯 Objective

Prepare your development environment and understand the basics of VSCode customization before diving into settings files.

---

## 🛠️ **Prerequisites Check**

Before we begin, make sure you have:

* ✅ **VSCode installed** on your computer
* ✅ **Basic familiarity** with VSCode interface
* ✅ **A project folder** where you can create settings files
* ✅ **Understanding** of basic file system operations

---

## 📁 **Setting Up Your Project**

1. **Use your project from Lesson 3 (POJO)**:
   ```bash
   cd your-pojo-project-folder
   ```
   
   > ✅ **Note:** You can use the same project folder you created for the POJO lesson. This keeps all your practice work organized in one place.

2. **Open the folder in VSCode** (if not already open):
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

3. **Create a `.vscode` folder** in your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir .vscode
   ```
   
   > ✅ **Important:** The folder name begins with a **dot (`.`)** — don't forget it! This makes the folder **hidden by default** on some systems. We often want config files to be hidden so they do not distract us from the files related to code.

4. **Create a test file** to see your settings in action. You may copy and paste code from a previous project to give yourself some code to start with.

   ```bash
   touch script.js
   ```
