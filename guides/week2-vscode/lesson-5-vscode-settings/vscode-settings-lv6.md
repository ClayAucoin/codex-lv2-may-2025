## Lesson: Advanced Settings and Exploration

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Explore additional settings, understand complex configurations, and create a complete settings file with all learned features.

---

## ðŸ§© **Challenge: Explore More Settings**

| Setting                        | Example Value                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"editor.minimap.enabled"`     | `false` â€” boolean, no quotes                                       |
| `"editor.lineNumbers"`         | `"on"` â€” string, quotes needed                                     |
| `"files.exclude"`              | `{ "**/node_modules": true }` â€” true/false, no quotes for booleans |
| `"search.exclude"`             | `{ "**/dist": true }` â€” same as above                              |
| `"workbench.sideBar.location"` | `"right"` â€” string, use quotes                                     |

> âœ… **Reminder:** Every key is quoted, strings are quoted, but numbers and booleans are **not** quoted.

---

## âœ… **Complete Example Settings File**

Update your `./vscode/settings.json` file to look like this:

```json
{
    "workbench.colorTheme": "Default Dark+",
    "editor.minimap.enabled": true,
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
    "workbench.editor.labelFormat": "short"
}
```

All strings here are **quoted**, and numbers and booleans are **not quoted**, following JSON rules.

---

## âœ… **Summary**

You learned how to:
* Explore advanced VSCode settings
* Understand complex configuration options
* Apply JSON syntax rules consistently
* Create a complete, functional settings file
* Customize your development environment for optimal productivity

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps**

* Experiment with the settings table above
* Try different combinations of settings
* Explore VSCode's settings documentation
  * [HTML Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html) RECOMMENDED!!!
  * [JSON Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json)
