## Lesson: Complete Settings File

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Create a complete settings file that combines all the configurations learned in previous levels.

---

## âœ… **Complete Example Settings File**

Update your `./vscode/settings.json` file to look like this:

```json
{
    "workbench.colorTheme": "Default Dark+",
    "editor.minimap.enabled": true,
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
    "workbench.editor.labelFormat": "short"
}
```

All strings here are **quoted**, and numbers and booleans are **not quoted**, following JSON rules.
