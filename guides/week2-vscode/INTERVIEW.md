✅ Step 1: Complete and Submit Your Mini Project Deliverable

Your deliverable is a published, working website created in VSCode and based on your Mini-Project for either Week 1 or Week 2  You will need to share your code by turning it in here, first.

This Interview will be based on skills with tools (shell, git, GitHub and VSCode). See Step 2 for details.

To share...

Open your website project on GitHub.

Publish with the "GitHub Pages"/

Copy the submission link and repo link(it will look like: https://your-name.github.io/project-name/... and https://github.org/your-name/project-name/...).

Paste your link in the submission form on Moodle.

🗣 Step 2: Prepare for Your TA Code Review

During class time, a TA will call upon you to meet for a short code review.  It will last between 10-15 minutes. This is your chance to demonstrate your understanding of the code you wrote.

Here's what you'll be asked to do:

🔍 **Show and explain your project**: What's your site about? Why did you build it this way? What encoding systems or concepts does it demonstrate?

💻 **Walk through your development workflow**: Explain your Git workflow, how you used commits, and push/pull commands. Show your repository structure and collaboration process.

💻 **Demonstrate tooling skills**: Show how you use VSCode, terminal commands, browser dev tools, and GitHub features. Explain your development environment setup.

✏ **Live-edit challenge**: You'll be asked to make a small change using your development tools (e.g., create a new branch, make a commit, use browser dev tools to inspect elements, or run a terminal command).

🧠 **Reflect**: "What would you improve or add if you had more time? How has your understanding of development workflows and tooling evolved?"

💡 Tip: Be prepared to talk like a developer. TAs want to hear your process and thinking, not perfection.

📣 You'll be called when it's your turn. Have your project open and ready!
