## Lesson: Multiple Elements and Challenges

### üéØ Objective

Practice creating multiple elements simultaneously and complete Emmet challenges.

---

## üìù **Note: What are these HTML tags?**

<details>
  <summary>What is a section tag for? (click to learn more)</summary>
  <div>
    <p>A <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag is used to group related content together. Think of it like a chapter in a book or a section in a newspaper. It helps organize your webpage into logical parts. For example, you might have a section for "About Us", another for "Contact Information", and another for "Latest News".</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is an article tag for? (click to learn more)</summary>
  <div>
    <p>An <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag is used for content that could stand on its own, like a blog post, news story, or product review. Think of it like an article in a magazine - it's a complete piece of content that makes sense even if you read it by itself. Articles are often placed inside sections.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is semantic HTML? (click to learn more)</summary>
  <div>
    <p>Semantic HTML means using HTML tags that describe what the content actually is, not just how it looks. Instead of using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> for everything, we use meaningful tags like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, etc. This makes your code easier to understand and helps search engines and screen readers better understand your content.</p>
  </div>
</details>

## ‚úÖ Step 12: Multiple Sections

* Type:

```
section>article*3>p*3 + [TAB]
```

What happened? Click to see.

<details>
  <summary>Click to see what happened</summary>
  <div>
    <p>This created a section containing three articles, and each article contains three paragraphs! This is a complex structure that would take much longer to write manually.</p>
  </div>
</details>

‚úÖ **Commit Reminder:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Create multiple articles with paragraphs using Emmet"
git push
```

> üîÑ **Workflow Reminder:** Remember to save (`Ctrl + S`) and refresh (`Ctrl + R`) as you make changes!

---

## ‚úÖ Step 13: Emmet Challenges

Try creating the following structures using Emmet shortcuts:

1. A nav with an unordered list of 4 links.
2. A footer containing a paragraph and a link.

**Hint:** Think about what you've learned:
- Use `nav` for navigation
- Use `ul>li*4` for 4 list items
- Use `a` for links
- Use `footer` for footer
- Use `+` to create sibling elements

‚úÖ **Commit Reminder:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Emmet challenges"
git push
```

> üîÑ **Workflow Reminder:** Remember to save (`Ctrl + S`) and refresh (`Ctrl + R`) as you make changes!
