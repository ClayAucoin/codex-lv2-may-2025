## Unit Overview: Emmet Shortcuts for HTML

### üß≠ Objective

In this unit, students will learn to use **Emmet**, a powerful shorthand system in VSCode to quickly write HTML. Students will practice various Emmet shortcuts, from basic elements to complex nested structures, while maintaining good version control practices.
