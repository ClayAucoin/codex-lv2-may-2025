## Lesson: Setup and Repository Creation

### üéØ Objective

Set up your development environment and create a local git repository with starter files for practicing Emmet shortcuts.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Create Your Repo and Starter Files

1. In the terminal, navigate to your desired folder.
2. Create a new repository on GitHub.
3. In the terminal, create a local git repo first:

```bash
mkdir emmet-practice
cd emmet-practice
git init
touch index.html style.css
git add .
git commit -m "Create index.html and style.css"
```

4. Now add the remote and push. First, create a repo on GitHub without a README, and follow the instructions there. The commands will look something like this:

```bash
git remote add origin <repo-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

‚úÖ **Commit Reminder:** You've already committed here ‚Äî good start!

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Open the Repo in VSCode

* Open the folder you just created in **VSCode**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Keep your `index.html` file completely blank for now. Don't add any content yet - we'll start adding HTML in the next level!

‚úÖ **Commit Reminder:** No code changes yet, so no commit needed.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

You've successfully:
* Created a local git repository
* Set up starter HTML and CSS files
* Connected your local repo to GitHub
* Opened the project in VSCode

You're now ready to start learning Emmet shortcuts!
