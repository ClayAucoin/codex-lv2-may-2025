<details>
  <summary>What is a CSS framework? (click to learn more)</summary>
  <div>
    <p>A CSS framework is a pre-written collection of CSS styles that you can use to quickly style your website. Instead of writing all your CSS from scratch, you can use a framework that provides ready-made styles for buttons, forms, layouts, and more. This saves time and ensures your website looks professional. Popular frameworks include Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and Sakura CSS.</p>
