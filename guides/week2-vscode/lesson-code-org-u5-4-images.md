**Lesson 4 Preview: Representing Images**

**Question of the Day:** *What system do computers use to represent images?*

In this lesson, you'll discover how computers "see" and store images. Since computers can’t interpret pictures like humans, they break images into tiny squares called **pixels**. Each pixel can be turned **on** or **off**—kind of like flipping a switch—to create black and white pictures.

You’ll use the **Pixelation Widget** to create your own pixel-based images and see how computers turn pictures into **binary code** (1s and 0s). Along the way, you’ll explore the challenges of representing detailed images using just pixels and binary.

By the end of the lesson, you’ll start to see how the same ideas used to represent **text** can also be used to represent **images**—just in a different format!
