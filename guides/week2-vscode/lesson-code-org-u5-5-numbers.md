**Lesson 5 Preview: Representing Numbers**

**Question of the Day:** *What system do computers use to represent numbers?*

In this lesson, you’ll learn how computers use the **binary number system** to represent whole numbers. Instead of using our regular base-10 system, computers rely on **base-2**, which uses only two digits: 0 and 1.

You’ll work with a set of cards that use dots to show **place values** in binary. By turning cards face up (on) or face down (off), you’ll create different patterns that represent different numbers—just like how computers use **bits** to store data.

By the end of the lesson, you’ll understand how binary numbers work and how computers can use just a few bits (like in a **4-bit system**) to represent many different values.
