## Unit Overview: Plain Old JavaScript Objects (POJOs)

### üß≠ Objective

In this unit, students will learn about Plain Old JavaScript Objects (POJOs) - a fundamental concept in JavaScript programming. Students will practice creating, reading, and updating object properties through hands-on exercises and challenges.

---

### üéØ Learning Goals

* Understand what POJOs are and how they store data
* Learn to create objects with properties and values
* Practice reading object properties using dot notation
* Master updating object properties with new values
* Apply POJO concepts to real-world scenarios like game development and data management

### üìö Lesson List

1. **[Setup and Look & Guess](./lesson-4-pojo-lv1.md)** *(Setup & Introduction)*  
   Set up the project environment and complete the initial "Look and Guess" activity to understand basic POJO structure.

2. **[What is a POJO? - 4 Exercises](./lesson-4-pojo-lv2.md)** *(Foundation)*  
   Learn to identify keys and values, create your own POJOs, explain object representations, and fix syntax errors.

3. **[Read and Update POJO Properties](./lesson-4-pojo-lv3.md)** *(Core Skills)*  
   Practice reading object properties and updating them with new values through guided exercises.

4. **[Practice Challenge](./lesson-4-pojo-lv4.md)** *(Application)*  
   Apply your skills by creating custom POJOs and performing read/update operations on books, pets, and sprites.

5. **[Bonus Challenge Exercises](./lesson-4-pojo-lv5.md)** *(Advanced)*  
   Complete advanced challenges involving player scoring, weather data updates, and robot movement simulation.
