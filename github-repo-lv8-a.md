#### Steps:

1. **Find or Upload an Image**

   * You can use an existing image URL (hosted online), *or*
   * Upload your own image to your repository:

     * Go to your repository.
     * Click **"Add file"** > **"Upload files"**.
     * Select your image (e.g., `mypic.jpg`) and click **Commit changes**.

2. **Edit Your HTML File**

   * Open your `index.html` file or another page like `about.html`.
   * Use the `<img>` tag to insert the image. Example:

```html
<img src="mypic.jpg" alt="A description of the image" width="300">
```

* If using an external image URL, replace `src` with the full link.

3. **Commit Your Changes**

   * Add a commit message like "Add image to homepage".
   * Commit directly to the main branch.

4. **Check Your GitHub Page**

   * Visit your GitHub Pages site.
   * Confirm the image displays correctly.

#### Practice Activity:

* Add one image to your homepage with a meaningful `alt` description.
* Try adjusting the image size using the `width` or `height` attribute.
* Show your project to a classmate and explain how you added the image.
